I'm keeping with the same premise as assignment 2 but expanding on it

The Full Effect: Start with "deathCastHomePage.html", click "Last Friend" near the bottom
  This takes you to the new "Last Friend App" page which is just a simple page with 2 'buttons'. 
    The buttons are: 
        "I AM A DECKER" 
          (press this one if you are the one dying today)
        "I AM NOT A DECKER"
          (Press this one if you are not the one dying today)

Both external sites will be nearly identical. I want to have a form or something where users can input data and get "matched" with some random with similar interestes
(I'm not sure if we'll learn this in this class, but I'd love to have a really basic/dumb AI messaging the user)
The form asks basics of the users (name, age, gender, height, weight, ethnicity, orientation, job, interests, favorite movie/book/tv show)
(These are "basics" are what are in the book)
