Websites I like/dislike:

disneyplus.com == DISLIKE
      
      Of all streaming sites this is my least favorite in terms of layout. Everything seems very messy and just all over the place. 
      It also takes forever to load and it can be pretty difficult to navigate. The collections that are options on the site is a nice touch though. 
      But overall I think the layout of this site is garbage and confusing.
      I think this site can be improved by putting the "continue watching" category at the top and having the media "remove itself" from that category
      when there's just credits left. Another improvement I can think of is when going to a category, the category name takes up about a third of the
      screen, which kind of gets in the way when scrolling through the shows, an imporovement would to make the category name be a lot smaller (especially
      since it's mainly a black bar with the title small and in the middle).

linnbenton.edu == DISLIKE
      
      The homepage is nice but accessing any other page on the site leads to a disaster. Content is missing, links don't always work,
      webpages load incorrectly, the search function is confusing, overall it's just not a nice website to utilize. 
      There's an overload of information on the site and none of it is useful or easy to get to.
      An improvement for this website would be to be less flashy and more informative. It's more focused on looking pretty than providing students (and others)
      with information.

youtube.com == LIKE
      
      The algorithm for choosing which videos you would like I think is very accurate. Everything you need is also right there at the beginning of the homepage, 
      you don't even need to scroll down. I like how everythihg is RIGHT there, front and center on the homepage. There's also a lot of information on the homepage, 
      but it seems really minimalistic and not busy which aids in finding what you're looking for. I also like how when you scroll the sidebar and searchbar stay
      ontop of the page and are easily accessesd without having to scroll back up.
      I think this site looks and functions amazingly, my only improvement would be to add a "my channel" button on the lefthand sidebar instead of it being in the
      top right corner. I think it would be easier since everything else is on the left sidebar, having the "my channel" button there I feel would make the site
      slightly more user friendly

nerdwallet.com == LIKE
      
      This site has really good information for one, and two I think the layout is really nice and easy to understand. It is a little jumbled on the homepage but
      it's quite easy to find the article/topic you are looking for. I do however wish you could just click on the broad categories and have it pull it up the
      subcategories instead of having to just hover your cursor over the category and choose from the drop-down menu, but other than that I think it's a very
      aestheticly pleasing website with pretty good functionality
      For an improvement I think users should be able to click the broad category name to have access to the articles in the category, right now it's a little
      too specific and hard to just "surf" through their articles.

apple.com == LIKE
      
      This website is simple, like YouTube, but also flashy like LBCC's site, but it works in this case. Apple products are just that, so I think it's interesting
      that their website matches it. Their products are all very flashy and "fancy" but are also sleek, professional, and simple. All of their products, at first
      glance (externally) have no real gimmics.
      I can't really think of any improvements, but their search page is kind of ugly, especially compared to the rest of the site. Possibly adding pictures to the
      search page would make it look better but that might hurt functionality
