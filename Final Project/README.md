Thanks for an awesome term

The best html to open first is deathCastPageFINAL.html thats the main homepage, although you can get to the home page from any of the other html documents

Looking back at the sites I chose 
Disneyplus:
  After learning what I know now about web design, I dont think this site is as bad as I originally said it was. I do still think it looks a bit cluttered but it makes sense why the developers designed it that way. It's not just random, it's organized by franchise (since Disney owns basically all of them). I do wish there was a bit more text elements and more spacing between thumbnails though, which knowing what I know now, wouldn't be too difficult of a fix
  
Linnbenton:
  I still agree with what I said at the beginning of the term for this site. I wish the focus was more on information than looking pretty. I now wish though that the nav bar at the top of the page stayed there so you don't have to scroll back up if you want to go to a different section, I think that would be a nice change. 

Youtube:
  I love the nav bars on this site and how they are able to be moved independently from each other. Knowing how to impliment nav bars gives me more appreciation to this design choice of theirs. I know before I praised it for its minimalistic design, but now I think it would be nice to have some more variety in color, or something.

Nerdwallet:
  Another site where I wish the nav bar stayed on top when you scrolled, I think that's such a nice feature of websites that seemingly goes overlooked, I think it would be nice if this site had that. I also wish the homepage had a bit more information than pretty colors and shapes (which is funny because I wish YouTube had less of this). The categories are pretty easy to figure out and search through and overall I think this is a pretty user friendly site. 

Apple:
  I still love apple's site. It's got the simplicity of YouTube with the flash of LBCC and NerdWallet. I think it's the perfect blend of the two AND it has the "sticky" nav bar which I love seeing on sites. It's extremely user friendly without seeming too "dumbed down". I think it fits its demographic perfectly without patronizing them. The site is a bit hand holdy in terms of how they direct you around the site, but I definitely think it works in Apple's case. I feel like the Apple Product Demographic is average (to below average) inteligence which leads to their hand holdy design. But they don't make it too obvoius that's what they're doing. Their phones are the exact same way though which is why I think the site works so well. 
  
  
  
My Projects:
  i really liked all the assignments this term, I felt they were super helpful in learning basic web development! 
  
  For project 1 I wish i didn't focus so much on the list elements and branched out a tad more in the html content
  
  For Project 2 I like how I switched it up and instead of doing Pokemon I used a book as inspiration for the site. I really liked how I decided to make the site background black instead of white, I think it makes it look more professional and fancy for some reason, even though it was a super easy style choice. I wish I didn't use a table for the images and video, but at the time I wasn't sure of a better way (and I'm still not quite sure of a better way) but in the code I feel the table makes things a bit more confusing.
  
  For Project 3 I liked how simple I kept it. I was really trying to make it look very simple and bleak, but also user friendly and fun. I think I kind of accomplished that, I definitely could've done more but I'm happy with how it turned out
  
  For Project 4 I enjoyed adding the JS elements. Although I wish I chose a better JS library and figured out more how to use those. I never realized how much javascript coult affect a website, and just by adding simple text boxes and buttons I feel it made the website look so much nicer and cleaner. I like the javascript I did include, even the weird elevator javascript library thing
  
  For Project 5 I was unable to get python to work on my mac and since I was already so late I didn't bother figuring out what to do to fix that or find another way
  
  For Project 6 (the final) I basically combined all my other assignments but prettied it up. I also included a "Do you die today?" button which based off a random number generator gives you a dialog box saying yes or no, which is something I wanted to add to the beginning so I'm glad I was able to add that. I probably could've looked up and attempted API but decided not to since this was already 3 days late my bad.
  
Thank you again for everything this quarter and being so understanding and patient.
