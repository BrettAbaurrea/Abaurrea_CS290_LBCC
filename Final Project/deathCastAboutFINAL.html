        <!--Basic about us, summarizing Death-Cast-->
        <p class="aboutSummary"><br>Death Cast was founded in 2011 as a way to give people the chance to say goodbye before they die.<br>
        Ever since then, a feeling of gratefulness washes over citizens when they pick up the phone;<br>
        and hear those beautiful words:<br>
        <i><b><br>I regret to inform you that sometime in the next twenty-four hours you'll be meeting an untimely death.</i></b></p>
